# Makefolio

A simple static site generator for image-heavy, project-based portfolios.

## Usage

### Folder Structure

Makefolio expects a specific folder structure of projects, with a directory for each project containing a markdown description file and a subdirecctory of project images. An additional YAML file is used to record metadata for the images, but makefolio will generate a skeleton of this file for you.

Your project files should be organized like this (with explanatory notes in italics):
  - Parent directory
    - _src *your site content*
      - projects
        - project one
          - img
            - image1.jpg
            - image1-lg.jpg
            - image2.jpg
            - image2-lg.jpg
            - *...*
          - project one.md *markdown-formatted project decription*
          - images.yaml *automatically generated by makefolio*
        - project two
          - *...*
        - project three
          - *...*
